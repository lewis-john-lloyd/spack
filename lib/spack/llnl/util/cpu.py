            name (str): name of the micro-architecture (e.g. skylake).
            parents (list): list of parents micro-architectures, if any.
                Parenthood is considered by cpu features and not
                chronologically. As such each micro-architecture is
                compatible with its ancestors. For example "skylake",
                which has "broadwell" as a parent, supports running binaries
                optimized for "broadwell".
            vendor (str): vendor of the micro-architecture
            features (list of str): supported CPU flags. Note that the semantic
                of the flags in this field might vary among architectures, if
                at all present. For instance x86_64 processors will list all
                the flags supported by a given CPU while Arm processors will
                list instead only the flags that have been added on top of the
                base model for the current micro-architecture.
            compilers (dict): compiler support to generate tuned code for this
                micro-architecture. This dictionary has as keys names of
                supported compilers, while values are list of dictionaries
                with fields:

                    compiler. This is the name passed to the ``-march`` option

                    passed in as argument above.
                * versions: versions that support this micro-architecture.

            generation (int): generation of the micro-architecture, if
                relevant.
